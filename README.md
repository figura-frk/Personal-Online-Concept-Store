# Personal-Online-Concept-Store

_As one of practice projects, I came up with the idea to create Personal Online Concept Store, where I use illustrations and products created by myself._
_The idea od this concept store came to my mind a long time ago, however only now I decided to start implementing it by using knowledge of HTML CSS and a bit of JS._ 

__The website contains:__
* Home Page 
  * _Includes illustration and navigation to other pages. Minimalistic and conceptual view_
* About Page 
  * _One more illustration and description of the whole concept_
* Store Page
  * _Includes some of the products, and the rest are repetitive as aplaceholder for future products and prices. As an idea in future, i'll be categorizing items for better navigation in between the products_
 * Contact Page
   * _Has a form to submit by a user or a customer in order to clarify questions or simply collab for future implementations_
